    <p>
    Captured by her masters again and brainwashed, Black Widow was forced to hire the Swordsman and Power Man to destroy the Avengers. This plot eventually failed when the Avengers defeated both of the villains and Natasha shook off the effects of the brainwashing.
    Attempting to make amends with the group, she assisted them against the racist group known as the Sons of the Serpent.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Having been granted amnesty, Natasha made a bid for membership in the Avengers, aiding them in their battle against the Ultroids.
    She threatened to kill their leader Ixar if he did not leave the Earth, winning the victory, however Hawkeye covered up this fact so that she could get membership in the group even though she violated their code of ethics regarding killing. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    However when Nick Fury hired her to spy on her former master on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D., she was be forced to decline membership with the Avengers and publicly broke off her relationship with Hawkeye.
    As part of her mission, the press branded her as a traitor, breaking Hawkeye's heart.
